## Installation

*Node.js* is our friend here, so make sure to download and install it from this link: https://nodejs.org/en/. Then, navigate to the project's folder, and run these commands.

```
npm install   //Installs missing dependencies
npm run dev   //Starts both the front-end and the back-end
```

## Usage

All of the required features for this challenge were successfully implemented. I took the opporrtunity to add a couple minor improvements to make the experience more enjoyable!

### 1. Field validation

If the user tries to search for waste items while the input field is empty, they get alerted of the error and the API call is not performed.

### 2. Empty list messages

When the favourite waste items list, and/or the search results list are empty, the user gets prompted on how to get started using the website.

### 3. No search results message

The user gets prompted when there is no results associated with a searched keyword.

## Technologies

Can you think of a better duo than peanut butter and jelly? Yeah, it's called using ReactJS for front-end and Express.js for back-end.

## Improvements

Although I didn't want to alter the proposed UI in the provided screenshot by adding extra features, I did think of creative future improvements for this project.

### 1. Pages for search results

If the user tries to search for waste items while the input field is empty, they get alerted of the error and the API call is not performed.

### 2. Clear all favourites button

When the favourite waste items list, and/or the search results list are empty, the user gets prompted on how to get started using the website.

### 3. Similar keywords when search has no matching results

The user gets prompted when there is no results associated with a searched keyword.
